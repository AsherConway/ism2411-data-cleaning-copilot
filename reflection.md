What Copilot generated
copilot generated the strucutre of functions in my datat celeaning script like load_data() and clean_column_names(). I gave clear instructions to copilot on what i wanted it to do like standardize column names, lowercase, remove dashes

What you modified
I added my own comments that explained each step and i modified copilots code so it coul,d convert numeric columns to numbers. I modified minor mistakes that AI can make. I also added all the headers to each code as copilot doesnt do this. I did it to make sure the code was readable and easy to understand.

What you learned
Using copilot showed me how to use AI tools responsibly in my work and that you still have to tough up code that AI gives you. It also taught me how to do the data cleaning process while coding. Through this assignment, I learned how advanced and helpful AI can be and the importance to not always trust exactly what AI gives you and make changes to the code it gives you when necessary.
